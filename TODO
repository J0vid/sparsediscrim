* TODO Add 'fast_svd' option to SimDiag
** TODO Determine how we should determine with class has larger rank

*** Write a function that does this.
*** By default, choose the order that the data sets are in.
*** Provide the user with an argument that allows for an automatic detection of q_1.

Tell the user that can this option can slightly increase the runtime, especially if the
data are not 'wide'.

    
* TODO Determine if 'Q' is a solution to a generalized eigenvalue problem
** TODO Read Generalized Eigenvalues Paper from OsoFast

This paper deals with positive semidefinite covariance matrices.
It might clearly define the generalized e'value problem well enough that I can
sufficiently describe our choice for Q as a solution to a generalized eigenvalue problem.

What's more is that some definitions of the GE problem solve: Ax = \lambda Bx. But B must
be nonsingular in order to transform the problem to the usual eigenvalue problem.
That is, B^{-1} Ax = \lambda x. But if B is singular, this is problematic.

* TODO Determine how to update RSDDA
* TODO Store the 'optimal' value of alpha in SDLDA and SDQDA

Make this available to the user. Also, include in this in print.sdlda

* TODO Update the documentation for Guo's simulation config with the notation.

Also, update the examples.
