* TODO Update SimDiag
** Provide thorough documentation on how to diagonalize a test observation

The purpose of this is so that I don't have to keep rethinking this on the fly.
My guess is this why my paper was not ready for that student paper competition.

** Provide a thorough unit test that simultaneously diagonalizes a well-formed case
** Provide a thorough unit test that simultaneously diagonalizes random high-dimensional data
* TODO Determine if 'Q' is a solution to a generalized eigenvalue problem
* TODO Determine how to update RSDDA
* TODO Store the 'optimal' value of alpha in SDLDA and SDQDA

Make this available to the user. Also, include in this in print.sdlda

* TODO Remove the 'foreach' package from 'Depends' in DESCRIPTION

Ensure that this doesn't break any code.
