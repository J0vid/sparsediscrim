* TODO Determine how to update RSDDA
* TODO Determine how to streamline the SimDiag.

Right now, there are at least 3 different ways to SimDiag in the package.
This is confusing to me. How much worse would it be for a new user?

* TODO Store the 'optimal' value of alpha in SDLDA and SDQDA

Make this available to the user. Also, include in this in print.sdlda

* TODO Remove the 'foreach' package from 'Depends' in DESCRIPTION

Ensure that this doesn't break any code.
